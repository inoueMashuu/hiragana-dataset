### How and why it was made?
This dataset was made using a Python program that using Image Processing techniques, extracted each individual character from a scanned sheet of paper with the characters written in it.

This is really a small dataset, but it works for testing purposes, such as making a Neural Network to identify each different hiragana using MATLAB, for example. A simple script to import this dataset to MATLAB is available in the repository.

# font-dataset
----
A small dataset with kana characters generated with 56 japanese fonts. This totals to about 7500 images.
